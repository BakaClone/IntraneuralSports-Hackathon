NS-SATS – National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services
a.	What files are in there – 5 datasets of treatment services for 2012-2016
b.	What information we can get from those files
•	Facility identification information
•	Operating entity
•	Primary focus
•	Type of care provided (outpatient, residential, hospital inpatient)
•	Services offered
•	Clinical/therapeutic approaches
•	Special programs or groups provided for specific client types
•	Provision of services in sign language and/or in languages other than English
•	Detoxification from alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, cocaine, methamphetamines, or other drugs, and routine use of medication during detoxification
•	Client outreach (outreach to persons in the community who may need treatment, provision of a facility website)
•	Licensure, certification, or accreditation agencies or organizations
•	Payment options accepted, including use of a sliding fee scale and/or treatment at no charge
•	Receipt of government funding
•	Smoking policy
•	Manner in which opioid dependence is treated, the operation of an opioid treatment program (OTP) certified by SAMHSA, and offering maintenance and/or detoxification with opioid drugs such as methadone or buprenorphine
•	Number of clients in treatment on March 31, 2016
•	Numbers and hours worked by paid and unpaid staff (analysis of these questions is not included in this report)
c.	What needs to be done to the files to make them more readily usable – import data sets to something that can manage and visualize the data, create legend form codebooks on what specific values mean in data
d.	What the information in the files might be useful for
•	Assess the nature and extent of services provided in state-supported and other substance abuse treatment facilities and in forecasting substance abuse treatment resource requirements
•	Analyze substance abuse treatment services trends and conduct comparative analyses for the nation, regions, and states
Optional: ideas for visualizations, statistics, etc. to summarize the info

TEDS - Treatment Episode Data Set 
a.	What files are in there – 2 data sets Admissions 2010-2015 and Discharges 2006-2014
b.	What information we can get from those files –

•	or buprenorphine) opioid therapy.
•	Type of service at discharge;
•	Length of stay; and
•	Reason for discharge or discontinuation of service.
c.	What needs to be done to the files to make them more readily usable – data sets are stored in csv, need to import to something that can view and utilize the easily
d.	What the information in the files might be useful for – statistics and visualizations for admissions and discharges – includes location, demographics, and treatments provided
e.	Optional: ideas for visualizations, statistics, etc. to summarize the info
